# PROJET-NATURAL-LANGAGE-PROCESSING

For this project, I worked with the News Category Dataset, which contains 200K headlines from English newspapers.

The objective of this project is to study the performance of Topic Modeling algorithms on the aforementioned dataset. To do so, we need to:

- Analyze the text corpus to extract its specific characteristics, such as the average size, types of words used, most frequent words, and stopwords.

- Select two Topic Modeling/Clustering methodologies that will allow us to process the data in the next phase.

- Define one or more metrics to measure the quality of your models.

- Perform comparative tests of each of the models you have selected.

- Conclude on the best methodology to use for the given problem and specify ways to improve the analysis.

Tools used: Python, Gensim, and Scikit-learn.
